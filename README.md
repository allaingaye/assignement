1. What is Logging?

Logging is the process of recording information about a program's execution. It includes details such as the flow of execution, errors, warnings, informational messages, and debug information. In the context of JSP and Servlets, logging typically involves capturing information about HTTP requests, responses, server activities, application events, and error handling.
2. Why Logging is Important

Logging is crucial for several reasons:

    Debugging: Logs help developers understand the flow of the application and identify where things go wrong.
    Monitoring: Logs provide real-time insights into the application's behavior, helping to monitor its health and performance.
    Audit Trail: Logs can serve as an audit trail for security and compliance purposes, recording who did what and when.
    Error Tracking: Logs capture errors and exceptions, allowing developers to diagnose and fix issues more efficiently.
    User Support: Logs can be used to trace user actions and assist in resolving user-reported problems.

3. Understanding Logging Levels

Logging levels indicate the severity or importance of the events being logged. Common logging levels, in increasing order of severity, include:

    TRACE: Very detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
    DEBUG: Detailed information on the flow through the system. Useful during development and debugging.
    INFO: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a high level.
    WARN: Potentially harmful situations or warnings that donâ€™t stop the application but could lead to issues.
    ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
    FATAL: Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
